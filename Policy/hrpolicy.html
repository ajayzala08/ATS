        <b>Here are some important items for all employees of Arche Softronix Pvt. Ltd. to know
            while working for us.
        </b><br><br><br>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Arrival and Work Timings </h2>
        <p>Employees must report to work on time for the scheduled shift. Upon arrival employees must
            punch in on biometric system. If an employee is going to be late they must call or send an
            email to hr@archesoftronix.com or the HR Manager. Please note that frequent lateness is not
            something that is acceptable and individuals will be expected to report to work on time.
            Disciplinary action could result if an individual is frequently late. Employees must also punch
            out on biometric system & send an email to hr@archesoftronix.com when they leave for the
            day. The office working hours is from 9:30 AM to 6:30 PM
        </p>
        <p>
            • Punch in after 9:40 AM will be calculated as Late Comings<br>
            • More than 3 Late comings in a month will lead to Half days on each late coming.<br>
            • Break Time are as below:<br>
            ➢ 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM<br>
            ➢ 4:00 PM to 4:15 PM<br>
            • First and Third Saturday will remain off.<br>
            • Second and Fourth Saturday will be working with the working hours as 9:30 AM to 3:30
            PM.<br>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin: 20px; padding: 50px;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Orientation and Training </h2>
        <p>
            To help you become familiar with the Company and our way of doing things, the Company
            will provide an orientation and training session within the first few days after you begin
            work. Some of the content of the session will depend in large part on the nature of your
            responsibilities, while other parts will be applicable to all employees. In addition, the
            Company may periodically offer additional training or educational programs. Some programs
            may be voluntary, while others will be required.
        </p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">At Will Employment </h2>
        <p>
            An at-will employee can be fired at any time, for any reason except for a few illegal
            reasons. If the employer decides to let you go, that's the end of your job--and you have very
            limited legal rights to fight your termination. If you are employed at will, your employer
            does not need good cause to fire you. In every state but Montana (which protects employees who
            have completed an initial "probationary period" from being fired without cause),
            employers are free to adopt at-will employment policies, and many of them have. In fact,
            unless your employer gives some clear indication that it will only fire employees for good
            cause, the law presumes that you are employed at will.
        </p>

    <section style="margin: 20px; padding: 50px;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Code of conduct </h2>
        <p>
            Arche Softronix will conduct its business honestly and ethically wherever operations are
            maintained. We strive to improve the quality of our services, products, and operations and
            will maintain a reputation for honesty, fairness, respect, responsibility, integrity, trust, and
            sound business judgment. Our managers and employees are expected to adhere to high
            standards of business and personal integrity as a representation of our business practices.
            We expect that officers, directors, and employees will not allow personal interests to
            conflict with the interests of the Company, its clients, or affiliates, nor will they
            misrepresent the Company or use their Company contacts to advance private or personal
            interests. The confidentiality of sensitive business information about our Company or
            operations, or that of our customers or partners, is to be treated with discretion and only be
            and only be disseminated on a need-to-know basis (see policies relating to privacy).
            Violation of the Code of Ethics can result in discipline, up to and including termination of
            employment. The degree of discipline imposed may be influenced by the existence of
            voluntary disclosure of any ethical violation and whether or not the violator cooperated in
            any subsequent investigation.<br><br>
            Any misuse of material inside information in connection with trading in the Company’s
            securities can expose an individual to civil liability and penalties under the Securities
            Exchange Act. Under this act, officers, managers, and employees in possession of material
            information not available to the public are considered “insiders.” Spouses, friends,
            suppliers, brokers, and others outside the Company who may have acquired such information
            directly or indirectly from an officer, manager, or employee are also “insiders.” The act
            prohibits insiders from trading in, or recommending the sale or purchase of, the Company’s
            securities, while such inside information is regarded as “material,” or if it is important
            enough to influence you or any other person in the purchase or sale of securities of any
            company with which we do business, which could be affected by the inside information. The
            following guidelines should be followed in dealing with inside information:
            Until material information has been publicly released by the Company, an employee must
            not disclose it to anyone except those within the Company whose positions require use of
            that information.<br><br>
            Officers, managers, and employees must not buy or sell the Company’s securities when they
            have knowledge of material information concerning the Company until it has been disclosed
            to the public and the public has had sufficient time to absorb the information.
            Officers, managers, and employees shall not buy or sell securities of another corporation,
            the value of which is likely to be affected by an action by the Company of which the
            employee is aware and which has not been publicly disclosed.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin: 20px; padding: 50px;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure of Trade Secrets</h2>
        <p>
            As a condition of employment, Company employees are required to protect the
            confidentiality of Company trade secrets and confidential information. Employees may come
            into contact with customer lists, operational or manufacturing procedures, or other
            confidential information. Access to this information should be limited to a “need to know”
            basis and should not be used for personal benefit, disclosed, or released without prior
            authorization from a supervisor.<br>
            Any employee who has information that leads them to suspect that an employee or
            competitor is obtaining the Company’s confidential information is required to inform their
            supervisor or Human Resources.<br>
            Unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets, or other confidential information, may result in
            the discipline or termination of any employee, as well as subject the employee to civil
            liability. Employees may not disclose or communicate, in any manner, directly or indirectly,
            information about the Company, its operations, clientele, or any other information, that
            relates to the business of the Company, including, but not limited to, the names of its
            customers or clients, its marketing strategies, operations, or any other information which
            would be deemed confidential, a trade secret, a customer or client list, or other form of
            proprietary information of the Company. If you believe you must disclose confidential
            information, you may do so only after obtaining prior authorization from your supervisor. Any
            breach of this provision, or of any other confidentiality and nondisclosure obligation, is a
            material breach of the terms of employment.

    <section style="margin: 20px; padding: 50px;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Leave Policy</h2>
        <p>Lack of proper leave management can lead to unauthorized absence of employees from duty,
            lower productivity, fall in productivity hours, missing of important targets and so on.
            These types of issues can be resolved with a proper Leave Policy Manual for employees in
            workplace. For instance, if an employee is on leave with no prior information his/her work
            suffers as nobody is prepared for the unexpected absence. But on similar terms if an
            employee applies for leave in advance in such case the stakeholder is aware of it and the
            entire team can manage the work in employee absence so that there is no loss of
            productivity.<br>
            Leave Policy when implemented in the company it provides a common understanding
            between the employer and employee that how leave can be taken while in service.
        </p>
        <b>Advantages of Leave Policy are: </b>
        <ul>
            <li>Having the right leave policy, it satisfies the legal obligation and safety.</li>
            <li>It helps in better relationship between the employer and the employee. </li>
            <li>It provides for more flexible time off.</li>
            <li>It ensures to avoid any kind of ambiguity how particular situation should be handled. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Objective:</b> The objective of the leave policy is to give provision to the employees to balance
            their personal as well as professional life. This leave policy is also meant to fulfill the
            statutory requirement regarding leave and holidays.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Purpose:</b> The purpose of leave policy for employees is to lay guidelines regarding when to
            avail leave and the process to take leave with pay, leave without pay, Leave of absence
            policy and so on
        </p>

    <section style="margin: 20px; padding: 50px;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Discrimination Policies:</h2>
        <b>Discrimination, in any form, will not be tolerated by Arche Softronix. We have set forth
            policies to protect our employees. Please review the below policies:
        </b><br>
        <b>Age Discrimination:</b>
        <p>
            Age discrimination involves treating someone (an applicant or employee) less favorably
            because of his age. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) only forbids age
            discrimination against people who are age 40 or older. It does not protect workers under the
            age of 40, although some states do have laws that protect younger workers from age
            discrimination. It is not illegal for an employer or other covered entity to favor an older
            worker over a younger one, even if both workers are age 40 or older. Discrimination can
            occur when the victim and the person who inflicted the discrimination are both over 40. The
            law forbids discrimination when it comes to any aspect of employment, including hiring,
            firing, pay, job assignments, promotions, layoff, training, fringe benefits, and any other
            term or condition of employment. It is unlawful to harass a person because of his or her age.
            Harassment can include, for example, offensive remarks about a person's age. Although the
            law doesn't prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that aren't very
            serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or
            offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as
            the victim being fired or demoted).The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor
            in another area, a co-worker, or someone who is not an employee of the employer, such as a
            client or customer. An employment policy or practice that applies to everyone, regardless of
            age, can be illegal if it has a negative impact on applicants or employees age 40 or older and
            is not based on a reasonable factor other than age (RFOA).
        </p>
        <b>The Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA) </b>
        <p>This law makes it illegal to pay different wages to men and women if they perform equal
            work in the same workplace. The law also makes it illegal to retaliate against a person
            because the person complained about discrimination, filed a charge of discrimination, or
            participated in an employment discrimination investigation or lawsuit.
        </p>
        <b>Dress Code and Public Image </b>
        <p>A Business Casual Dress Code is what our company standard is. This means no Clothing that
            reveals too much cleavage, your back, your chest, your feet, your stomach or your
            underwear is not appropriate for a place of business, even in a business casual setting.
        </p>
        <p>
            A. Jewelry, Makeup, Perfume, and Cologne: Should be in good taste, with limited
            visible body piercing. Remember, that some employees are allergic to the chemicals
            in perfumes and make-up, so wear these substances with restraint.<br>
            B. Hats and Head Covering: Hats are not appropriate in the office. Head Covers that are
            required for religious purposes or to honor cultural tradition are allowed.<br>
            C. Fridays: Fridays we are designating as Jeans and a nice shirt. Jeans may not be torn
            or ripped in any manner.<br>
            D. Conclusion: If clothing fails to meet these standards, as determined by the
            employee's supervisor and Human Resources staff, the employee will be asked not to
            wear the inappropriate item to work again.<br>
            If the problem persists, the employee may be sent home to change clothes and will
            receive a verbal warning for the first offense. All other policies about personal time
            use will apply. Progressive disciplinary action will be applied if dress code violations
            continue.

						against the person who has made the complaint, including termination of service. In such
						a case, malicious intent has to be established after an inquiry, before any action is
						recommended. A mere inability to substantiate a complaint or provide adequate proof
						would not attract action as provided herein. A similar recommendation for taking action
						would be recommended against any witness whom the Internal Complaint Committee
						concludes, that he/she has given false evidence or produced forged or misleading
						documents.
